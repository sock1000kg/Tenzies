# Tenzies

A simple dice game built with **React + Vite** â€” my first real project using React.
The goal is to roll the dice until all values match, holding the ones you want to keep between rolls. Winners will get confetti as congratulation!

Built while learning React from **Bob Ziroll's** course on **Scrimba**.

## How to Play
- Click **Roll** to roll all dice.
- Click on dice to **hold** their value.
- Keep rolling until **all dice are the same** number.
- Win! ðŸŽ‰ (And maybe a little confetti.)
